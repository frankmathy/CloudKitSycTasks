# CloudKitSycTasks
This is a demo application for synchronization + share of Core Data with CloudKit under iOS. It is a minimal tasklist app which demonstrates the following techniques:

* Locally store tasks using Core Data.
* Write local task changes into iCloud using CloudKit.
* Subscribe to notifcations of remote task changes in iCloud / CloudKit and sync them into local Core Data storage (in progress).
* Share tasks with others via Core Data sharing (to be implemented).
* Accept invitations to tasks, create local copy in Core Data and send updates (to be implemented).
